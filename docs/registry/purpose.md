## What is the purpose of a Kevoree registry?
The registry is a database of Kevoree models mainly used by [KevScript](/docs/kevscript/introducing-kevscript.md) interpreters to resolve TypeDefinitions and DeployUnits.  

You can [register](https://registry.kevoree.org/#/register) right now and publish your own content within minutes.
