### Why Kevoree?
Adaptive systems are complex! Even more when they are distributed!

The Model@Run.time strategy adopted by Kevoree aims at offering a clean, safer and simpler way to interact with distributed systems. Using models first, Kevoree allows users to define complex adaptations easily, to build for instance self-healing systems. Extensible, this project already offers runtime for JVM, Javascript and soon .NET, but also for virtualization management such as Docker. In short, Kevoree is helping you to develop your heterogeneous, distributed and adaptive software from cloud stacks to embedded devices!

### What is it?
Build around a component model, Kevoree leverages the model@run.time paradigm to offer tools to build, adapt and synchronize distributed systems.
